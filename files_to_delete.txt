DECISION ON dataV05_with_all_features.csv:
  - This is an intermediate dataset (33 variables)
  - Can be deleted if space is needed
  - The final dataset (54 variables) is available as final_dataset_with_weather_clusters.csv

SUMMARY:
--------
KEEP (Essential):
  - ml_dataset_all_features.csv
  - ml_dataset_selected_features.csv  
  - feature_lists.txt
  - univariate_test_results_all_features.csv
  - create_ml_ready_dataset.py
  - univariate_feature_selection.py (final version)

DELETE (Safe to remove):
  - nul
  - 10+ redundant/intermediate files in feature_selection_analysis/

SPACE SAVINGS: ~10-15 MB by removing redundant CSV files and scripts
